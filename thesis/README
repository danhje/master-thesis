Files used to create my dissertation
------------------------------------

Here are most of the files (except figures) I used to produce my
dissertation.  This directory contains only the LaTeX files, other
things are in subdiretores:

figs	   figures
tabs	   tables
quotes	   quotations
scripts	   several useful MATLAB files

Note that the figs and tabs directories (which are empty here), were
subdivided, so that each chapter had its own figure and table
directory for better overview.

TeX files are as follows:

thesis.cls      thesis class file, based on book, see comments at
	        beginning of file
disscmds.sty	definition of many TeX commands used to make life
	        easier, especially when typing formulas
diss.tex	the main dissertation file
chicago.*	LaTeX and BibTeX style files for the bibliography

The remaining files are files for the individual chapters.

NOTE: This material is provided here to help you to give you ideas on
      how to use LaTeX best to produce YOUR OWN thesis.  You may copy
      any LaTeX commands used, etc, but if you want to copy text, you
      have to ask me first!  Only the files thesis.cls, disscmds.sty,
      and the MATLAB scripts in subdirectory scripts are provided
      under the GNU Public License (see scripts/LICENSE.TXT).
